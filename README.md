# Measuring co-localization of ion images

This repository is devoted to a project on measuring co-localization of mass spectrometry images. The project is carried out by the [Alexandrov team](https://www.embl.de/research/units/scb/alexandrov/) at EMBL Heidelberg. We created a webapp for ranking pairs of ion images, engaged external experts to rank images from their public data from [METASPACE](http://metaspace2020.eu), consolidated the results into a gold standard set of ranked pairs of ion images, and, finally, developed and evaluated various measures of co-localization.

For more information, please see our recent paper [Ovchinnikova et al. (2020) Bioinformatics](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa085).

## Creating gold standard ion images

### Using public METASPACE datasets

We used public datasets from [METASPACE](http://metaspace2020.eu), a community-populated knowledge base of metabolite images. Please see the section Acknowledgements acknowledging contributors of the used data.

RankColoc was rapidly prototyped using the [METASPACE codebase](https://github.com/metaspace2020/metaspace/) as a foundation,
allowing its back-end, image display and ranking to be reused. The RankColoc-specific changes can be found 
[in this commit range](https://github.com/metaspace2020/coloc/compare/2d316a9049c561e5f5b7a0deded05930a435dc14...67f8fa10e5aa1f7a1052c4adaae997a489b9ce52). 

## Data

### Gold standard

The gold standard is available [here](https://github.com/metaspace2020/coloc/tree/master/GS).
The ion images are available under `gs_imgs1` and `gs_imgs2` file names. To join both files into one arhive run `cat gs_imgs* > gs_imgs.tar.gz`

The initial expert rankings can be found in `rankings.csv`, the filtered gold standard with average rankings is in `coloc_gs.csv`.

## Colocalization measures

### Measures requiring no learning

Measures requiring no learning are available in the jupyter notebook `ion_intensity_coloc_measures.ipynb` [here](https://github.com/metaspace2020/coloc/tree/master/measures/NoLearning).

### Measures based on deep learning

Measures based on deep learning are available [here](https://github.com/metaspace2020/coloc/tree/master/measures/DLcoloc).

## Future steps

We are planning to integrate the best methods into [https://metaspace2020.eu](https://metaspace2020.eu).
